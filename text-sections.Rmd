# Introduction 

In this lab report, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is performed on three different responses variable and a subset of predictors chosen from the 2011 Bike Sharing dataset $^{[1]}$. The response variables of our concern are: 

1. the count of **casual** daily bike rentals 
2. the count of **registered** daily bike rentals
3. the count of **total** daily bike rentals

The model should help answer the following question: what are the **daily** bike rentals under different conditions? Business owners may like to know the daily bike rentals in 2012 so that they could optimize the inventory to reduce costs, and they may also wonder whether it is worth leaving the bike-sharing system open on days with extreme weather conditions. This can be done by performing predictive modeling on the daily rental variable based on data given in 2011.
